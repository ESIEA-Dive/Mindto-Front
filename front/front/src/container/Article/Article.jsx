      <p className='po-text mop'>Do you ever feel anxious about showing up to a party where you only know a couple people? Or just being
around a crowd becomes a little too overwhelming? You're not alone; one of the most under-talked topics
these days is social anxiety.</p> 
      <p className='po-text'>But Jay Shetty brings up this important topic in his podcast, “On Purpose.” Interestingly enough, Shetty
brings in Tom Holland, better known as, Spiderman. They dig into Tom's life and how he struggled with
social anxiety.</p>
      <p className='po-text'>Knowing that Spider Man struggles with social anxiety makes me feel like I'm not the only one who deals
with this. Even super heroes struggle with their emotions, and social anxiety doesn't discriminate against
anyone - supernatural or not.</p>

      <p className='red-box'>What is Social Anxiety?</p>
      <p className='po-text'>Social anxiety is defined as a  <a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/social-phobia.html">ong fear of social situations</a>, typically with public speaking, talking in
large groups, and meeting new people. This anxiety happens when a person's body notices a situation and
thinks it's dangerous. When this happens, the body produces a lot of adrenaline and other chemicals
associated with a person's fight-or-flight response - making them feel really nervous, and have physical
symptoms.</p>
      <p className='po-text'>Social anxiety has increased a lot over the last few years; it's estimated that <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/social-anxiety-disorder
">12.1% of U.S. adults will
experience social anxiety in their lifetime.</a> That's about 1 out of every 9 people. Two major factors, the
COVID-19 pandemic and social media use, have increased the rates of social anxiety in the world.</p>
      <p className='white-box'>The Pandemic</p>
      
      <p className='po-text'>It's no secret that COVID-19 changed the way we interact with each other. With decreased interactions
with people, and the fear of contracting the illness, came the fear of social interactions. This isolation
created a 25.6% increase in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9915904/">anxiety disorders</a> which is approximately 76.2 million new cases of anxiety
disorders across the globe. Low income individuals, as well as women, were more likely to be impacted by
anxiety disorders during COVID.</p>
      
      <p className='white-box'>Social Media</p>

      <p className='po-text'>Social media has slowly taken over within the last couple of years. Gen Z and even Millennials are
constantly on their phones scrolling through Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat…you name it. Studies show
that most people spend between 2.5 and 3 hours a day on social apps. The adverse mental effects such as
social anxiety due to such use is evident.</p>
<p className='po-text'>For example, a study of 17,340 students from seven colleges in China revealed that prominent use of social
media was negatively correlated to social anxiety. Why? Simply put, it's human nature to compare
yourself to other users who appear to have something “better” than you do.</p>
      
<p className='po-text'>Social media use also puts our in-person social skills on hold. Staying behind a screen may decrease social
anxiety for the short term. However, it may increase the level of social anxiety long term because of less
exposure to in-person interaction.</p>
      
      

      <p className='red-box'>Family Time Shapes Our Social Interactions</p>
      <p className='g-text'>“ How we are loved or unloved from ages 0-5 impact the next
15-25 years of our life and how we give love to ourselves and
how we give love to others ” - Shetty</p>
      <p className='po-text'>Prior research shows that parental rejection, or experiencing reject by family members is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6445571/">associated with
increased social anxiety.</a> Connection with family, and encouraging empathetic relationships in the family
can help decrease social anxiety.</p>
<p className='po-text'>Back to Shetty's podcast, Tom talks about how he had an amazing family foundation where growing up
he was lucky enough to have both of his parents at home and felt like they were always a team. This
helped his social anxiety, due to having a support system in his family. As a result of that, Tom speaks
about wanting his own close knit family in the future.</p>

    <div className='app__article-table'>

      <div className='app__title'>
        <a className='hello'>1</a>
        <p className='plop'>Begin to expose yourself to social situations</p>
      </div>
      <p className='po-text-y'>Dr. Dawn Potter, PsyD., a clinical psychologist with the Cleveland Clinic, says that <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-overcome-social-anxiety/">slowly
starting to take part in anxiety-provoking situations can help</a> people with social anxiety
overcome them. One example of “situational exposure” is trying to present something in front
of a group of family members, if you're afraid of public speaking.</p>


      <div className='app__title'>
        <a className='hello'>2</a>
        <p className='plop'>Practice being gentle to yourself</p>
      </div>
      <p className='po-text-y'>Feeling overwhelmed by all these changes? You're not alone - it can be a lot to overcome some
of these fears. Try making an affirmation to yourself every day, such as “I am good enough” or
“I am working hard and deserve rest”. <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-overcome-social-anxiety/">These can help you practice self-care, and develop love
and value in yourself.</a>
</p>

      <div className='app__title'>
        <a className='hello'>3</a>
        <p className='plop'>Decrease your time on social media</p>
      </div>
      <p className='po-text-y'>While “social” is in the phrase, social media use is not always beneficial for improving anxieties
about ourselves or others. Taking a break from social media for an hour a day can be helpful in
improving the feelings of anxiety. Trying a new hobby to fill that time, for example, walking,
running, playing an instrument, or reading a book, can be helpful in channeling your anxiety
into something else.</p>
<div className='app__title'>
        <a className='hello'>4</a>
        <p className='plop'>Reaching out for support</p>
      </div>
      <p className='po-text-y'>Support systems are great to have, especially when dealing with social anxiety. Finding family,
friends, coaches, teammates, or other people to reach out to is especially helpful when dealing
with social anxiety. This can be especially useful before big decisions or events.
If you feel like you need more help than a member of your support system can provide, speak
with your healthcare provider for support.</p>
