      <p className='red-box'>Leadership everywhere!</p>
      <p className='po-text'>Leadership is never easy but it takes this skill to create a good culture whether it's in your business, company, team, or in life. A lot of times in the workplace, we notice that a lot of bosses and CEO's focus on rules, and what needs to get done, yelling and resorting to negative tactics to make sure employees
      get the message. Yet, we don't talk about how and what motivates us to do it efficiently and in a positive
      way</p> 
      <p className='po-text'> In his <a href='https://jayshetty.me/blog/susan-wojcicki-and-jay-shetty-on-avoiding-burnout-as-a-leader/'>podcast</a>, Jay Shetty, a famous author, public speaker, and former Hindu monk, talks about having
      purpose and how building strong leadership goals, helps people create a positive culture and better
      response in life</p>

      <p className='red-box'>Leadership styles</p>
      
      <p className='po-text'>Leadership styles isn't one size fits all, and there isn't a right or a wrong answer to which ones you should
      do. Every leadership style has its pros and cons. There are many different styles of leadership and how to
      run a team. Here are 3 typical leadership styles we can see in our day-to-day life</p>

      <div className='big-red-box'>
      <h3 className='red-y'>Autocratic</h3>  
      <p>Also known as authoritarian, autocratic leadership can be summed up as “do as you're told”
type of leadership. This style normally has one figure at the top dictating to the others what to
do, some may feel micromanaged and overwhelmed in this style while others may like it as
results and rules are clear, it's one person making the decisions so there is no overlap or
confusion.</p>
      <h3 className='red'>Democratic</h3>  
      <p>This leadership style involves having input from all. Everybody has a voice and rules and requests
are discussed with the group. Everybody is equal and tasks are divided up so that nobody feels
inferior. This style can heighten people's morale and create a more positive environment,
however inevitably can lead to some of them not feeling heard or left out when their ideas aren't
chosen.</p>
      <h3 className='red'>Laissez-faire</h3>  
      <p>Don't let the French fool you; laissez-faire doesn't just mean “let it be”. Rather, this leadership
style empowers members of the team to accomplish the task without micromanaging and
interrupting. <br />
This style works great with decision-making and team building, not having to wait for their
decisions to get approved by a higher-up associate. However, with the wrong team/group, this
style can impact them negatively if the employees aren't motivated or need more direction when
completing a task.</p>    
            
            {/* <ul className='list red'>
                  <li>skipping breakfast</li>
                  <li>waiting till noon to eat your first meal</li>
                  <li>finishing your last meal by eight at night</li>
            </ul> */}
      </div>

      <p className='po-text'>We always hear of leadership but we don't always focus on just how important it is for a successful team,
organization, or company. By becoming more aware of the type of leader you want to be and the
strategies and keys to being a “better” leader, you can create more success in whatever aspect of your
life. The earlier you start developing your leadership skills, the more helpful you'll be to your teammates
and yourself.</p>
      

      <p className='red-box'>3 keys to leadership</p>
      <p className='po-text'>Leadership is a journey, not a destination. It takes time, effort, and practice to become a great leader.
But it's worth it. Here are 3 keys to developing your leadership skills:</p>
      </div>



    <div className='app__article-table'>

      <div className='app__title'>
        <a className='hello'>1</a>
        <p className='plop'>Culture comes first</p>
      </div>
      <p className='po-text-y'>We hear about culture all the time but what really is it. Culture is one of the greatest drives to
good leadership. When you're part of a team, what makes that team successful isn't that every
person in it is good at what they do.</p>
      <p className='po-text-y'>Coaches already recruit the best players, but it's up to the captain and team to build a family.
Culture doesn't just mesh the players together but it creates an environment that's enjoyable
to go to every morning.</p>
      <p className='po-text-y'>Getting to know each teammate, where when you come into the locker room it isn't “Hey what
position do you play” but “Where are you from? What do you like to do?”
, it builds relationships within the system and thus creates a bonded team.</p>

      <div className='app__title'>
        <a className='hello'>2</a>
        <p className='plop'>Talk more, less rules</p>
      </div>
      <p className='po-text-y'>Don't get me wrong, it's good to have structure and we need rules. But imaging playing for a
coach that is a one-man show and commands everything. He is the sole rule creator and if
anybody goes against him, they get punished: drills for X amount of minutes, not being allowed
to leave the courts mid-practice, etc.
</p>
      <p className='po-text-y'>Research has shown that rules imposed by others rather than being co-created drives
engagement down. <br />
Being a good leader means talking to your team. Having good conversations but also the tough
ones too. A good leader drives through communication with their team, creating rules together
and holding someone accountable when they are not doing their job.</p>
      <p className='po-text-y'>Instead of dictating, let's talk more!</p>

      <div className='app__title'>
        <a className='hello'>3</a>
        <p className='plop'>Focus on the strengths</p>
      </div>
      <p className='po-text-y'>Sometimes we focus too much on what a person did wrong, what needs to be better, and
without realizing we snowball into the negatives.</p>
<p className='po-text-y'>Good leadership skills include focusing on ones positives. Telling them what their strengths are
and acknowledging to them that they are an asset.<br/>
A study was done by <a href='https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236369/strengths-based-development-manager-role.aspx '>Gallup</a> where they found that organizations that implemented a strength-based approach to employee development had:
</p>

<ul className='list red-y'>
                  <li> 10-20% increased sales</li>
                  <li> 26%-72% of lower turnover rates</li>
                  <li> 9%-15% engaged employees</li>
                  <li> 14%-29% increased profit for the company
</li>
</ul>
<p className='po-text-y'>The research is clear. Focusing on ones strengths…is a strength! Instead of criticizing one
another, take the time to compliment a teammate on how punctual they are, how responsible
and organized a team member is, or how great the energy is they bring day in and day out to
the dressing room!
